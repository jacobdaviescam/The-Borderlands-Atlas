# üåø Aesthetic Guide: The Greenhouse Study

## Vision

*A study within a greenhouse: bookshelves spanning from Dostoevsky to deep learning, ivy creeping over leather-bound volumes, an old map connecting disparate ideas, and a drinks globe with carefully crafted cocktails nearby.*

This site captures the aesthetic of a scholar's refuge where plants and books coexist, where a Negroni sits beside ancient philosophy, and where knowledge from disparate fields mingles at the borderlands.

## Design Philosophy

### Barely-There Details
All elements are designed to be **subtle enhancements** rather than dominant features:
- Opacity levels: 15-70%
- Delicate line weights: 1-2px
- Small scale relative to page
- Peek in from edges rather than center

### Layered Aesthetic
Multiple themes coexist without competing:
1. **Base layer**: Parchment & typography (scholarly)
2. **Botanical layer**: Vines & leaves (greenhouse)
3. **Literary layer**: Books & maps (study)
4. **Bar layer**: Glassware & pairings (lounge)

### Contextual Details
Different sections emphasize different aspects:
- **Homepage**: All elements balanced
- **Blog**: Heavy on books & pairings
- **Atlas**: Map/cartography focus
- **Code**: More minimal, modern
- **About**: Glassware & personal touch

## How to Use

### Adding Pairings to Blog Posts

Edit your markdown frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-10-13"
excerpt: "Description"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
pairsWith:
  book: "The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky"
  drink: "Negroni ‚Äî bitter, complex, contemplative"
---
```

**Tips for Pairings:**
- **Book**: Can be fiction, non-fiction, poetry‚Äîwhatever complements the essay's theme
- **Drink**: Include tasting notes or why it pairs (e.g., "rich and layered", "sharp and refreshing")
- Either field is optional

### Customizing Botanical Elements

**To adjust vine opacity:**
Edit `app/components/BotanicalDivider.tsx` or `app/page.tsx`:
```typescript
opacity="0.6"  // Change to 0.3-0.9
```

**To change botanical color:**
```typescript
className="text-forest"  // Change to text-navy, text-brass, etc.
```

**To add more leaves:**
Add more `<path>` elements following the pattern:
```svg
<path d="M x y Q x y x y" fill="currentColor" className="text-forest" opacity="0.5" />
```

### Adding New Corner Details

Edit `CornerOrnaments()` in `app/page.tsx`:
- Each corner is a separate `<motion.div>`
- Add SVG elements inside the existing structure
- Follow opacity conventions (0.3-0.6 for main elements)
- Use transform attributes for positioning

## Visual Examples

‚îÉ  üç∑ Negroni ‚Äî bitter, complex, contemplative
```

## Future Enhancements

**Potential additions** (all maintaining the barely-there philosophy):

1. **Seasonal botanicals**: Different plants per season
2. **Animated vines**: Subtle grow animations on scroll
3. **Vintage map borders**: On atlas pages
4. **Bookshelf sidebar**: On larger screens
5. **Cocktail recipe cards**: Expandable drink details
6. **Reading list integration**: Dynamic book recommendations

## Maintaining the Aesthetic

### Do's ‚úÖ
- Keep elements subtle (30-70% opacity)
- Use forest green for botanical
- Use burgundy for book/wine elements
- Add details at edges, not center
- Layer elements without overcrowding

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- Don't make botanicals too prominent
- Don't use bright/saturated greens
- Don't center decorative elements
- Don't add elements without purpose
- Don't override the clean content areas

---

**The goal**: Create an atmosphere where you feel like you're sitting in a greenhouse study with a good book, a well-crafted drink, and ivy creeping along the walls‚Äîscholarly, comfortable, and at the beautiful intersection of nature, literature, and craft.
