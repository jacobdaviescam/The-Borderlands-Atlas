## üìö Philosophy

The Borderlands Atlas is inspired by the concept of epistemic humility‚Äîthe recognition that the edge of knowledge is where the most interesting work happens. It's a space for:

- Mapping what we know
- Acknowledging what we don't
- Planning expeditions into the unknown
- Finding beauty in the liminal spaces between disciplines

*"Welcome to the borderlands‚Äîthat liminal space where certainty fades and curiosity begins."*
